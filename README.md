Hi there, I'm Ibad Ullah 👋
💻 Lead Software Engineer | 🎮 Indie Game Developer
🚀 About Me
I’m a results-driven software engineer with 4+ years of experience building multi-tiered applications, embedded systems, and full-stack solutions. Currently working as Lead Software Engineer at Sabro Technologies, I specialize in:

.NET Framework/Core (C#, VB.NET, Blazor, WinForms)

Real-time & embedded communication (ESP32, Modbus RTU, MQTT, Bluetooth)

Game development with Unity (PC & Mobile)

Firebase/SQL Server-based backend systems

Team leadership, technical recruitment, and mentoring

I'm passionate about bridging software with hardware, and I love prototyping tools and systems that solve real-world problems—or creating games that bring people joy.
