## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate Software Engineer currently working at **Sabro Technologies**, with hands-on experience in:
- **C#, .NET, WinForms & Firebase Integration**
- **IoT Solutions with ESP32, MQTT, and Modbus RS-485**
- **Flutter App Development**
- **Unity Game Development (PC & Mobile)**

I love building solutions that bridge hardware and software, and I occasionally dive into game design to bring interactive experiences to life.
