###  About Me  
I’m a results-driven software engineer with **3+ years of experience** building multi-tiered applications, embedded systems, and full-stack solutions.  

Currently working as **Software Engineer at Sabro Technologies**, I specialize in:

- **.NET Framework/Core** (C#, VB.NET, Blazor, WinForms)  
- **Real-time & embedded communication** (ESP32, Modbus RTU, MQTT, Bluetooth)  
- **Game development with Unity** (PC & Mobile)  
- **Firebase/SQL Server-based backend systems**  
- **Team leadership, technical recruitment, and mentoring**

I'm passionate about bridging software with hardware, and I love prototyping tools and systems that solve real-world problems—or creating games that bring people joy.
